# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dirt iOS app has grown organically and now requires architectural refactoring to create a clean, maintainable codebase with modern iOS 18+ Material Glass design patterns. The current codebase contains a mix of active, inactive, and experimental code that needs systematic organization, cleanup, and modernization while preserving existing functionality and preparing for future feature development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized codebase architecture, so that I can efficiently maintain and extend the app without confusion about which files are active or deprecated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all active, inactive, and unused files
2. WHEN organizing the architecture THEN the system SHALL follow iOS best practices with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have a documented file structure with clear ownership and purpose for each component
4. IF files are unused or deprecated THEN the system SHALL remove them or clearly mark them as archived
5. WHEN creating the new architecture THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement iOS 18+ Material Glass design system, so that the app feels modern and follows current Apple design guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the design system THEN the system SHALL use Material effects (.ultraThinMaterial, .thinMaterial, etc.)
2. WHEN applying visual updates THEN the system SHALL maintain existing UX flows while modernizing the visual presentation
3. WHEN updating UI components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper Dark Mode support
4. WHEN implementing glass effects THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility standards and readability
5. WHEN creating Material Glass components THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent visual hierarchy and spacing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feature boundaries and modular architecture, so that features can be developed and tested independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing features THEN the system SHALL group related functionality into cohesive modules
2. WHEN defining module boundaries THEN the system SHALL minimize dependencies between features
3. WHEN implementing shared components THEN the system SHALL place them in appropriate Core or Shared directories
4. WHEN creating new features THEN the system SHALL follow established architectural patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and development guidelines, so that future development follows consistent patterns and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide updated README files for each major component
2. WHEN establishing patterns THEN the system SHALL document coding standards and architectural decisions
3. WHEN organizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL create clear guidelines for where new code should be placed
4. WHEN documenting the architecture THEN the system SHALL include dependency diagrams and module relationships

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing functionality during refactoring, so that no features are lost or broken during the architectural improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing UX flows and features
2. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL update all import statements and references
3. WHEN reorganizing components THEN the system SHALL ensure all tests continue to pass
4. WHEN completing refactoring THEN the system SHALL verify that all documented features in PLAN.md still work correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved build performance and reduced technical debt, so that development velocity increases and maintenance becomes easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing imports THEN the system SHALL eliminate circular dependencies
2. WHEN structuring the project THEN the system SHALL optimize build times through proper module organization
3. WHEN cleaning up code THEN the system SHALL remove dead code and unused dependencies
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have measurably improved build and test execution times
5. WHEN consolidating services THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve performance characteristics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear development roadmap and milestone structure, so that future feature development can be planned and executed systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN architectural refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a clear roadmap for implementing remaining PLAN.md items
2. WHEN organizing development priorities THEN the system SHALL align with the existing milestone structure (M1-M5)
3. WHEN planning future work THEN the system SHALL identify which components need to be built vs refactored
4. WHEN establishing the roadmap THEN the system SHALL prioritize UX stability before visual polish as stated in PLAN.md
