# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the complete UI/UX remaster of the Dirt dating feedback app to achieve production-ready quality that closely matches the proven design patterns from the Tea app screenshots. The current implementation has basic functionality but lacks the polished, engaging, and intuitive interface required for a successful dating app. This remaster will transform the app from a functional prototype into a visually compelling, user-friendly application that follows modern iOS design principles and dating app UX best practices.

The remaster encompasses all major app flows including onboarding, authentication, feed browsing, post creation, profile management, notifications, and settings, with particular attention to visual hierarchy, interaction design, animations, and overall user experience quality.
