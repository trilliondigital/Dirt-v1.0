# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains architectural decision records documenting the major design choices made during the Dirt iOS app refactoring.

## Overview

ADRs provide a historical record of architectural decisions, their context, and rationale. They help future developers understand why certain choices were made and provide guidance for consistent decision-making.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Decision Process

When making architectural decisions:

1. **Document Context**: Clearly describe the problem or situation
2. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate multiple approaches
3. **Make Decision**: Choose the best approach with clear rationale
4. **Document Consequences**: Record both positive and negative outcomes
5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit decisions as the codebase evolves
