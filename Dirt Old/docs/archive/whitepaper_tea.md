### ⚠️ Data Breach & Privacy Concerns (July 2025)

- On **July 26, 2025**, a data breach occurred via an unprotected legacy storage system (not necessarily a direct "hack"), exposing **around 72,000 images** — including **13,000 selfies and government‑ID photos** from users who signed up before February 2024, plus ~59,000 publicly shared photos [ABC7 Los Angeles+5ABC News+5People.com+5](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/new-dating-advice-app-tea-rockets-1-app/story?id=124067965&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### ✅ Pros & 🛑 Cons

#### ✅ Safety Tools & Community

- Advocates see it as a digital **whisper network** that empowers women by providing insight into potential partners and supporting safer dating decisions [Wikipedia+15Fast Company+15People.com+15](https://www.fastcompany.com/91374409/everything-to-know-about-tea-the-viral-and-controversial-app-that-lets-women-mark-men-as-red-flags?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
#### 🛑 Criticisms & Risks

- Critics warn of **defamation**, **misinformation**, and **digital vigilantism**—since posts are anonymous and not verified [Tea for Women+1New York Post+1](https://www.teaforwomen.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- Concerns that men could have false allegations posted about them, with limited mechanisms to dispute or remove content quickly [Business Insider+6Sky News+6News.com.au+6](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- The data leak raised major **privacy and ethical concerns**, especially since personal ID photos were still retained despite promises of deletion [Houston Chronicle+2People.com+2News.com.au+2](https://people.com/dating-safety-app-women-spot-red-flags-hacked-11780178?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 💰 Tea’s Monetization Model

#### 1. **Subscription-Based Safety Tools**

Tea offers core features for free (posting “red flag” or “green flag” reviews, browsing community feedback), but advanced safety tools are behind a premium paywall:

- Reverse image searches to detect catfishing
    
- Background checks, criminal record lookups, and court document searches
    
- Phone number lookup and sex-offender database access  
    These premium tools are bundled into a **monthly subscription**, reportedly priced at **$14.99/month** [Quasa+10Fast Company+10The Economic Times+10](https://www.fastcompany.com/91374409/everything-to-know-about-tea-the-viral-and-controversial-app-that-lets-women-mark-men-as-red-flags?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/24/tea-dating-app-women-review-men/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Medium](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/sean-cook-of-tea-on-5-things-you-need-to-know-to-create-a-highly-successful-app-bc2f2ac6a131?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

#### 2. **Usage Limits + Unlock via Referrals**

- Free accounts are capped in usage (e.g., **five free searches per month**)
    
- Users can unlock unlimited access either by subscribing or **referring friends** to join Tea [Business Insider+1Wikipedia+1](https://www.businessinsider.com/tea-app-women-share-anonymous-dating-reviews-goes-viral-2025-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

#### 3. **Charitable Giving Partnership**

- Tea commits to donating **10% of profits** from its paid subscriptions to the **National Domestic Violence Hotline**  
    This is publicized as part of their mission-driven marketing and aligns with their positioning as a safety-first platform [thesun.co.uk+4Fast Company+4Business Insider+4](https://www.fastcompany.com/91374409/everything-to-know-about-tea-the-viral-and-controversial-app-that-lets-women-mark-men-as-red-flags?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### ⚠️ Lessons & Recommendations for “Scoop”

To avoid pitfalls and stay compliant while monetizing _responsibly_:

- ✅ **Offer core features for free** (posting & viewing reviews)
    
- ✅ **Charge for premium tools**—for example:
    
    - Enhanced search filters (e.g. by tag frequency)
        
    - Access to aggregated community stats, trends, or daily digests
        
- ✅ **Avoid data sales or PII-based monetization**
    
- ✅ **Consider mission-aligned giving** to signal social responsibility
    
- ✅ **Keep referral-based unlocks**, but make subscription an option  
    without gating fundamental safety or community features
    

---

### 🧭 Takeaway

Tea monetizes through a classic freemium model: basic community features are free, while in-depth tools like background checks, image search, and unlimited usage are locked behind a subscription. They supplement this with referral bonuses and a socially conscious profit-sharing pledge that reinforces their safety‑first brand. For **Dirt**, a similar strategy—minus the potentially controversial criminal background checks or private records—can align well with Apple’s guidelines while offering value to your users.

Would you like help calculating projected revenue based on subscription take-up, designing referral incentives, or exploring App Store-approved alternative monetization like in-app consumables or grouped premium features?


## 🤔 Is there a male version of the Tea app?

Yes — a men‑focused app called **Cheeky** has emerged as a response to Tea. Similar in style, Cheeky offers forums for anonymous discussions about women, dating challenges, and general relationship feedback, targeted primarily at men [Dazed Digital+13Sky News+13Reddit+13](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- NBC News and Sky News report that **Cheeky** branded itself as "our response to the Tea app" [YouTube+4Sky News+4Business Insider+4](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Teaborn** was another men-only app attempting a similar model, but it gained notoriety for hosting revenge‑porn content and was taken down by its creator shortly thereafter [abcnews.go.com+7The Verge+7Sky News+7](https://www.theverge.com/cyber-security/714750/tea-hack-breach?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

Beyond that, there isn't a widely adopted, scalable platform that mirrors Tea's anonymous user‑review system for men.

### ⚖️ Comparison Overview

| Platform    | Intended Users | Core Concept                             | Status / Outcome                                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tea**     | Women only     | Anonymous reviews of men; safety-focused | Viral in mid‑2025; now facing major data breach issues |
| **Cheeky**  | Men only       | Anonymous discussions about women/dating | Recently launched as a response to Tea                 |
| **Teaborn** | Men only       | Similar anonymous review model           | Shut down amid scandal over shared content             |

---

### 🧱 Broader Context

While Tea built on the concept of "whisper networks" (like Facebook groups such as _Are We Dating the Same Guy?_), earlier platforms like **Lulu** allowed only women to rate men—with men being reviewed but not posting reviews themselves. Lulu eventually pivoted away from that format and is no longer active in its original form [New York Post+14en.wikipedia.org+14Business Insider+14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_%28app%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[the-sun.com+4Business Insider+4The Verge+4](https://www.businessinsider.com/tea-anonymous-viral-app-direct-messages-exposed-breach-researcher-2025-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Other apps (e.g. **Jyst** or **Nattr**) let users crowdsource dating advice or responses to messages, but are not gender-specific feedback platforms and don't mirror Tea's review system [Dazed Digital+15glamour.com+15en.wikipedia.org+15](https://www.glamour.com/story/jyst-dating-advice-app?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- **Cheeky** is the only recently launched men-only app positioned as the male counterpart to Tea.
    
- **Teaborn** existed briefly but was quickly taken down due to misuse.
    
- No large-scale, widely used platform currently replicates Tea’s review model for men with similar features, scale, and community structure.
    

Would you like a deep dive into how Cheeky works, or explore general platforms for men-centered dating feedback or advice?

[Women's 'red flag' app Tea is a privacy nightmare](https://www.theverge.com/cyber-security/714750/tea-hack-breach?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Currently, among the apps targeting men with a model similar to **Tea (anonymously reviewing romantic partners)**—things are pretty thin:

---
## 🧍‍♂️ Apps Available on the Apple App Store

- **No equivalent to Tea is currently available for download.**
    
    - While a platform called **Cheeky** has been described in media reports as a _men-focused response to Tea_, there’s **no evidence that such an app actually exists on the Apple App Store** [thesun.co.uk+12news.sky.com+12goodmorningamerica.com+12](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
    - Searches did uncover **Cheeky Events**, but that’s an app tied to _in-person speed dating events_, not an anonymous review or feedback network. It is only functional during those events, not a broader social app for ongoing reviews [apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheeky-events/id6450106982?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
- Other apps like **Cheeky Chat**, **Cheekd**, or **Cheekd Events** are unrelated concepts (e.g. structured messaging or Bluetooth-based local alerts) and _not men-only anonymous review platforms_ [apps.apple.com+3apps.apple.com+3datingscout.com+3](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/cheeky-chat-meet-play-love/id6445944385?l=en-GB&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
---

### ⚠️ Summary

- Although speculative platforms such as **Cheeky** or **Teaborn** have been mentioned in commentary as male-targeted counterparts to Tea, **none are currently live or available on the App Store**.
    
- Existing versions bearing similar names serve entirely different functions—mostly dating logistics or event participation, **not whisper-network style feedback systems**.

Here’s a professionally engineered **cursor prompt** tailored to help you **design, code, and publish** the _Scoop_ app — a men-only anonymous review platform — on the Apple App Store. It assumes you're using a codegen AI like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to assist in rapid development.

---
## 🌊 Windsurf Prompt
### 🧠 Prompt Objective

> Build a secure, scalable, and App Store-compliant mobile app called **Scoop** that allows **men only** to anonymously share, read, and respond to red/green-flag experiences with romantic partners (mirroring the functionality of the “Tea” app for women). Focus on robust moderation, privacy, and user verification protocols.

### 💻 Full Cursor Prompt

```
You are an expert full-stack iOS engineer, AI pair programmer, and App Store deployment strategist. Your goal is to help me build and ship a Swift-based iOS app called **Scoop** — a men-only, anonymous review platform inspired by the Tea app.

---

## 🧱 App Concept: Scoop (Men-Only Anonymous Dating Review App)

- Purpose: Allow male users to anonymously share reviews (positive or negative) about romantic experiences with women.
- Posts include:
  - Optional photo upload (blurred by default)
  - Relationship category: One-night stand, Long-term, Dating app match, etc.
  - Red flag / Green flag indicator
  - Tags: e.g. “ghosted,” “lied,” “cheated,” “amazing communicator,” “emotionally supportive”
  - Optional text description (max 500 characters)
- Users can react to posts or mark them as helpful
- Community features: search by name or tag, real-time alerts for new posts matching keywords
- Admin dashboard for moderation + flagging system

---

## 🔐 Key Requirements

1. **Male-Only Verification (Without IDs)**
   - Use onboarding questions and facial recognition (optional) or voiceprint authentication to verify gender heuristically
   - Gamify community flagging to improve self-regulation
   - Don't collect or store PII unless strictly necessary

2. **Anonymity**
   - No user-facing usernames
   - Store user data securely with UUIDs
   - End-to-end encrypted review content

3. **Moderation System**
   - Auto-flag offensive or defamatory content using OpenAI moderation endpoint
   - Manual moderation dashboard for admin users
   - User voting system (e.g. if 10+ votes say "false", post is auto-hidden for review)

4. **Security & Privacy**
   - Use Firebase Auth or Supabase for backend auth & rate-limiting
   - Apple Sign-In integration required for App Store compliance
   - Blur all photos by default until tapped
   - Remove EXIF metadata on upload

5. **UI/UX**
   - Use SwiftUI for frontend
   - Dark mode by default
   - Onboarding: “What is Scoop?” → Gender verification → Terms agreement → Start browsing
   - Tabs: Feed | Search | Submit | Alerts | Profile

---

## 🛠️ Stack Preferences

- Frontend: SwiftUI
- Backend: Supabase (or Firebase)
- Moderation: OpenAI Moderation API + custom admin flag dashboard
- Notifications: OneSignal or Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Analytics: Mixpanel or Firebase Analytics
- Deployment: TestFlight → App Store
- Hosting: Vercel or Supabase edge functions for minimal latency

---

## 🎯 Deliverables You Should Help Me Generate

1. SwiftUI components for Feed, Search, Post Modal, Profile
2. Supabase schema for users, reviews, tags, votes
3. Moderation logic with OpenAI moderation API
4. Secure photo upload logic with automatic metadata strip + blur
5. Apple-compliant App Privacy Policy & Terms of Use (AI-generated OK for v1)
6. Deployment steps for TestFlight & App Store submission
7. Best practices for app icon, screenshots, and App Store listing

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

This app is not about hate or harassment. It’s about protecting men from repeated negative dating experiences and celebrating green flags. Anonymity must never come at the cost of another person’s safety. Every feature must balance transparency with empathy.

---

Please begin with the backend schema and SwiftUI file structure.

## ✅ Guardrails to Prevent App Store Rejection

|Area|Implementation|
|---|---|
|**Male-only access**|Heuristic (non-ID) gender filter with onboarding self-attest + optional voiceprint; NO discrimination.|
|**No real names**|No fields accept first/last names of people being reviewed.|
|**No PII sharing**|Moderation filters block any form of phone numbers, usernames, photos of others, etc.|
|**Moderation**|All posts pass OpenAI’s moderation endpoint + in-house filters before going live.|
|**Anonymity limits**|Users have UUIDs, but all content is traceable (for abuse control).|
|**Report feature**|Built-in ability to flag reviews; abuse leads to suspension or ban.|
|**Blurred media**|All uploaded photos are blurred by default with no zoom enabled.|
|**Policy compliance**|Privacy Policy + Terms of Use autogenerated for App Store review.|

## 🧩 Dirt Supabase Schema (PostgreSQL SQL)

Here’s the **production-ready Supabase schema** for your Scoop MVP — designed to support anonymity, robust moderation, and App Store compliance.

```
-- 👤 Users (anonymous UUID-based)
create table users (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  apple_id text unique,  -- Apple Sign-In token (not email)
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  last_active timestamp with time zone default now(),
  reputation_score integer default 0,  -- community trust score
  is_admin boolean default false
);

-- 📝 Reviews
create table reviews (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references users(id) on delete cascade,
  flag_type text check (flag_type in ('red', 'green')),
  category text,  -- e.g. "one-night stand", "long-term", "app match"
  tags text[],    -- e.g. ['ghosted', 'emotionally supportive']
  content text check (length(content) <= 500),
  image_url text, -- uploaded via secure CDN (blurred by default)
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  is_visible boolean default true,  -- auto-hidden if flagged
  helpful_votes integer default 0
);

-- 🏷️ Tags
create table tags (
  id serial primary key,
  name text unique,           -- e.g. "ghosted", "cheated"
  sentiment text check (sentiment in ('positive', 'negative')),
  usage_count integer default 0
);

-- ⚠️ Community Flags (moderation)
create table flags (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  review_id uuid references reviews(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid references users(id) on delete cascade,
  reason text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

-- ✅ Mod Actions
create table moderation_actions (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  review_id uuid references reviews(id) on delete cascade,
  admin_id uuid references users(id),
  action text check (action in ('hide', 'delete', 'warn', 'ban_user')),
  note text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

-- 🔔 Notifications (opt-in)
create table alerts (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references users(id) on delete cascade,
  keyword text,               -- e.g. "Sarah", "ghosted"
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

### 🔐 Key Compliance & Safeguards

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`is_visible`|Used to soft-hide content after community flags or mod review|
|`content` length capped|Ensures bite-sized, low-defamation potential|
|No real names enforced|No name fields stored in schema or allowed in UI|
|`apple_id` stored safely|Only the opaque token, not user PII|
|Flagging with reason|Enables mod accountability + transparency|
|`tags` structured|Prevents offensive slang and ensures clean sentiment filtering|

## 🧭 Components

Here are production-grade SwiftUI components for your Scoop MVP, fully structured, reusable, and annotated for clarity and App Store compliance. These include the **FeedView** and **PostView**, which handle review browsing and anonymous posting.

### `FeedView.swift`

```
import SwiftUI

struct FeedView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = FeedViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(viewModel.reviews) { review in
                    ReviewCard(review: review)
                        .padding(.vertical, 6)
                        .onTapGesture {
                            viewModel.toggleBlur(for: review)
                        }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Scoop Feed")

### 🛠️ 3. Moderator Panel Tools (Admin UI Spec)

#### 🔧 UI: `FlaggedPostsView.swift`

```
struct FlaggedPostsView: View {
    @StateObject private var modVM = ModerationViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(modVM.flaggedReviews) { flagged in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(flagged.content).lineLimit(3)
                    HStack {
                        Button("Hide Post") {
                            modVM.hidePost(flagged)
                        }
                        Button("Ban User") {
                            modVM.banUser(flagged.userID)
                        }
                    }.buttonStyle(BorderlessButtonStyle())
                }
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle("Moderation Queue")
        .onAppear {
            modVM.loadFlaggedReviews()
        }
    }
}
```

#### 🔐 Logic: `ModerationViewModel.swift`

```
class ModerationViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var flaggedReviews: [Review] = []

    func loadFlaggedReviews() {
        SupabaseManager.shared.fetchFlaggedReviews { result in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.flaggedReviews = result
            }
        }
    }

    func hidePost(_ review: Review) {
        SupabaseManager.shared.markReviewInvisible(review.id)
    }

    func banUser(_ userID: UUID) {
        SupabaseManager.shared.disableUser(userID)
    }
}
```

#### 🛡️ Safeguards

- Auto-hide if flagged >5x
    
- “Ban” = disables all future posting
    
- No PII ever shown in mod view

## 💸 Monetization Architecture for Dirt

Let’s now integrate monetization into your **Scoop MVP**, modeled after Tea’s system — while staying 100% App Store-compliant.

We’ll use **StoreKit 2** (native Swift API for in-app purchases) and design a **freemium subscription model**:

---

| **Feature Tier**     | **Free Users**                 | **Pro Users** (`$4.99–$9.99/month`)        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| View reviews         | ✅ Unlimited                    | ✅                                          |
| Post reviews         | ✅ Unlimited                    | ✅                                          |
| Search by tags       | ✅ Basic filters                | ✅ Advanced filter logic (e.g. frequency)   |
| Keyword alerts       | ❌                              | ✅ Real-time push alerts                    |
| Community insights   | ❌                              | ✅ See most-flagged tags, most active areas |
| AI credibility check | ❌                              | ✅ Sentiment & veracity estimate            |
| Referrals unlock     | ✅ 1 referral = 7-day Pro trial | ✅                                          |

### 🧠 StoreKit Setup (`SubscriptionManager.swift`)

```
import StoreKit

class SubscriptionManager: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = SubscriptionManager()

    @Published var isSubscribed: Bool = false
    @Published var products: [Product] = []

    private var updates: Task<Void, Never>? = nil

    init() {
        updates = Task {
            for await result in Transaction.updates {
                await self.updateSubscriptionStatus()
            }
        }

        Task {
            await self.loadProducts()
            await self.updateSubscriptionStatus()
        }
    }

    func loadProducts() async {
        do {
            self.products = try await Product.products(for: ["scoop_premium_monthly"])
        } catch {
            print("Error loading products: \(error)")
        }
    }

    func purchase(product: Product) async throws {
        let result = try await product.purchase()
        switch result {
        case .success(let verification):
            switch verification {
            case .verified(let transaction):
                await transaction.finish()
                await updateSubscriptionStatus()
            default:
                break
            }
        default: break
        }
    }

    func updateSubscriptionStatus() async {
        for await result in Transaction.currentEntitlements {
            if case .verified(let transaction) = result,
               transaction.productID == "scoop_premium_monthly" {
                await MainActor.run {
                    self.isSubscribed = true
                }
                return
            }
        }
        await MainActor.run {
            self.isSubscribed = false
        }
    }
}
```

### 🧾 `PaywallView.swift`

```
import SwiftUI
import StoreKit

struct PaywallView: View {
    @StateObject var subManager = SubscriptionManager.shared

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("Upgrade to Scoop Pro")
                .font(.largeTitle).bold()
            Text("Get advanced search, tag alerts, trend insights, and more.")
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)

            ForEach(subManager.products) { product in
                Button("Subscribe – \(product.displayPrice)") {
                    Task {
                        try? await subManager.purchase(product: product)
                    }
                }
                .padding()
                .background(Color.blue)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .cornerRadius(10)
            }

            Button("Restore Purchases") {
                Task { try? await AppStore.sync() }
            }

            Spacer()
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### 🔐 Example Gated Access (e.g. Tag Search in FeedViewModel)

```
if !SubscriptionManager.shared.isSubscribed {
    // Basic search: show top 5 tags only
    self.filteredTags = allTags.prefix(5)
} else {
    self.filteredTags = allTags
}
```

### 🎁 `ReferralManager.swift` (Conceptual)

```
class ReferralManager {
    static let shared = ReferralManager()

    func redeemReferral(code: String, completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) {
        // Check Supabase for referral code, give 7-day access if valid
        SupabaseManager.shared.redeemReferralCode(code: code) { success in
            if success {
                SubscriptionManager.shared.isSubscribed = true
            }
            completion(success)
        }
    }

    func generateCode(for userID: UUID) -> String {
        return "SCOOP-\(userID.uuidString.prefix(8))"
    }
}
```

### ✅ App Store Compliant Monetization Strategy

- StoreKit2 (Apple-approved)
    
- Feature gating only on **enhancements**, not core usage
    
- Referral unlocks are allowed (no cash rewards = safe)
    
- Content moderation, no pay-to-harass features
