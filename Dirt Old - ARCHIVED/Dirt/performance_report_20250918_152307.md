Generated: Thu Sep 18 15:23:07 CDT 2025

## Summary

- Total Performance Tests: 18
- Passed: 10
- Failed: 8
- Success Rate: 55%

## Architecture Performance Metrics

### Build Performance
- Clean build time target: <120 seconds
- Incremental build time target: <30 seconds

### Code Quality Metrics
- Core code percentage target: <40% of total
- Large files (>500 lines) target: <5 files

### Material Glass Performance
- Performance optimizations implemented
- Animation optimizations for accessibility
- Lazy loading patterns utilized

### Memory Management
- Weak references for delegate patterns
- Proper cleanup in deinit methods
- Caching strategies implemented

### Dependency Injection
- Lazy service initialization
- Minimal singleton usage
- Environment injection patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Build Performance**: Monitor build times regularly and optimize module dependencies
2. **Memory Usage**: Continue using weak references and proper cleanup patterns
3. **Material Glass**: Maintain performance optimizations for smooth 60fps animations
4. **Testing**: Expand performance-specific test coverage
5. **Assets**: Use vector assets where possible for better scalability

## Next Steps

- Set up continuous performance monitoring
- Implement automated performance regression tests
- Monitor memory usage in production
- Regular performance audits
