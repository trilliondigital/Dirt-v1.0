### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Breach & Privacy Concerns (July 2025)

- On **July 26, 2025**, a data breach occurred via an unprotected legacy storage system (not necessarily a direct "hack"), exposing **around 72,000 images** ‚Äî including **13,000 selfies and government‚ÄëID photos** from users who signed up before February 2024, plus ~59,000 publicly shared photos [ABC7 Los Angeles+5ABC News+5People.com+5](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/new-dating-advice-app-tea-rockets-1-app/story?id=124067965&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### ‚úÖ Pros & üõë Cons

#### ‚úÖ Safety Tools & Community

- Advocates see it as a digital **whisper network** that empowers women by providing insight into potential partners and supporting safer dating decisions [Wikipedia+15Fast Company+15People.com+15](https://www.fastcompany.com/91374409/everything-to-know-about-tea-the-viral-and-controversial-app-that-lets-women-mark-men-as-red-flags?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
#### üõë Criticisms & Risks

- Critics warn of **defamation**, **misinformation**, and **digital vigilantism**‚Äîsince posts are anonymous and not verified [Tea for Women+1New York Post+1](https://www.teaforwomen.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- Concerns that men could have false allegations posted about them, with limited mechanisms to dispute or remove content quickly [Business Insider+6Sky News+6News.com.au+6](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- The data leak raised major **privacy and ethical concerns**, especially since personal ID photos were still retained despite promises of deletion [Houston Chronicle+2People.com+2News.com.au+2](https://people.com/dating-safety-app-women-spot-red-flags-hacked-11780178?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### TL;DR

Tea is a **women-only app** focused on improving dating safety by enabling anonymous feedback on men. It‚Äôs fast-growing and widely used, but faced serious backlash in late July 2025 due to a data breach exposing naming and ID photos. The app remains controversial for both its intent and implications.

## üí∞ Tea‚Äôs Monetization Model

#### 1. **Subscription-Based Safety Tools**

Tea offers core features for free (posting ‚Äúred flag‚Äù or ‚Äúgreen flag‚Äù reviews, browsing community feedback), but advanced safety tools are behind a premium paywall:

- Reverse image searches to detect catfishing
    
- Background checks, criminal record lookups, and court document searches
    
- Phone number lookup and sex-offender database access  
    These premium tools are bundled into a **monthly subscription**, reportedly priced at **$14.99/month** [Quasa+10Fast Company+10The Economic Times+10](https://www.fastcompany.com/91374409/everything-to-know-about-tea-the-viral-and-controversial-app-that-lets-women-mark-men-as-red-flags?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/24/tea-dating-app-women-review-men/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Medium](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/sean-cook-of-tea-on-5-things-you-need-to-know-to-create-a-highly-successful-app-bc2f2ac6a131?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

#### 2. **Usage Limits + Unlock via Referrals**

- Free accounts are capped in usage (e.g., **five free searches per month**)
    
- Users can unlock unlimited access either by subscribing or **referring friends** to join Tea [Business Insider+1Wikipedia+1](https://www.businessinsider.com/tea-app-women-share-anonymous-dating-reviews-goes-viral-2025-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

#### 3. **Charitable Giving Partnership**

- Tea commits to donating **10% of profits** from its paid subscriptions to the **National Domestic Violence Hotline**  
    This is publicized as part of their mission-driven marketing and aligns with their positioning as a safety-first platform [thesun.co.uk+4Fast Company+4Business Insider+4](https://www.fastcompany.com/91374409/everything-to-know-about-tea-the-viral-and-controversial-app-that-lets-women-mark-men-as-red-flags?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

| **Revenue Stream**            | **Details**                                         |

| **Social Impact Tie-in**      | 10% of profits donated to domestic violence hotline |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Lessons & Recommendations for ‚ÄúScoop‚Äù

To avoid pitfalls and stay compliant while monetizing _responsibly_:

- ‚úÖ **Offer core features for free** (posting & viewing reviews)
    
- ‚úÖ **Charge for premium tools**‚Äîfor example:
    
    - Enhanced search filters (e.g. by tag frequency)
        
    - Access to aggregated community stats, trends, or daily digests
        
- ‚úÖ **Avoid data sales or PII-based monetization**
    
- ‚úÖ **Consider mission-aligned giving** to signal social responsibility
    
- ‚úÖ **Keep referral-based unlocks**, but make subscription an option  
    without gating fundamental safety or community features
    

---

### üß≠ Takeaway

Tea monetizes through a classic freemium model: basic community features are free, while in-depth tools like background checks, image search, and unlimited usage are locked behind a subscription. They supplement this with referral bonuses and a socially conscious profit-sharing pledge that reinforces their safety‚Äëfirst brand. For **Dirt**, a similar strategy‚Äîminus the potentially controversial criminal background checks or private records‚Äîcan align well with Apple‚Äôs guidelines while offering value to your users.

Would you like help calculating projected revenue based on subscription take-up, designing referral incentives, or exploring App Store-approved alternative monetization like in-app consumables or grouped premium features?


## ü§î Is there a male version of the Tea app?

Yes ‚Äî a men‚Äëfocused app called **Cheeky** has emerged as a response to Tea. Similar in style, Cheeky offers forums for anonymous discussions about women, dating challenges, and general relationship feedback, targeted primarily at men [Dazed Digital+13Sky News+13Reddit+13](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- NBC News and Sky News report that **Cheeky** branded itself as "our response to the Tea app" [YouTube+4Sky News+4Business Insider+4](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Teaborn** was another men-only app attempting a similar model, but it gained notoriety for hosting revenge‚Äëporn content and was taken down by its creator shortly thereafter [abcnews.go.com+7The Verge+7Sky News+7](https://www.theverge.com/cyber-security/714750/tea-hack-breach?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

Beyond that, there isn't a widely adopted, scalable platform that mirrors Tea's anonymous user‚Äëreview system for men.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Overview

| Platform    | Intended Users | Core Concept                             | Status / Outcome                                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tea**     | Women only     | Anonymous reviews of men; safety-focused | Viral in mid‚Äë2025; now facing major data breach issues |
| **Cheeky**  | Men only       | Anonymous discussions about women/dating | Recently launched as a response to Tea                 |
| **Teaborn** | Men only       | Similar anonymous review model           | Shut down amid scandal over shared content             |

---

### üß± Broader Context

While Tea built on the concept of "whisper networks" (like Facebook groups such as _Are We Dating the Same Guy?_), earlier platforms like **Lulu** allowed only women to rate men‚Äîwith men being reviewed but not posting reviews themselves. Lulu eventually pivoted away from that format and is no longer active in its original form [New York Post+14en.wikipedia.org+14Business Insider+14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_%28app%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[the-sun.com+4Business Insider+4The Verge+4](https://www.businessinsider.com/tea-anonymous-viral-app-direct-messages-exposed-breach-researcher-2025-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Other apps (e.g. **Jyst** or **Nattr**) let users crowdsource dating advice or responses to messages, but are not gender-specific feedback platforms and don't mirror Tea's review system [Dazed Digital+15glamour.com+15en.wikipedia.org+15](https://www.glamour.com/story/jyst-dating-advice-app?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR

- **Cheeky** is the only recently launched men-only app positioned as the male counterpart to Tea.
    
- **Teaborn** existed briefly but was quickly taken down due to misuse.
    
- No large-scale, widely used platform currently replicates Tea‚Äôs review model for men with similar features, scale, and community structure.
    

Would you like a deep dive into how Cheeky works, or explore general platforms for men-centered dating feedback or advice?

Currently, among the apps targeting men with a model similar to **Tea (anonymously reviewing romantic partners)**‚Äîthings are pretty thin:

---
## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Apps Available on the Apple App Store

- **No equivalent to Tea is currently available for download.**
    
    - While a platform called **Cheeky** has been described in media reports as a _men-focused response to Tea_, there‚Äôs **no evidence that such an app actually exists on the Apple App Store** [thesun.co.uk+12news.sky.com+12goodmorningamerica.com+12](https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
    - Searches did uncover **Cheeky Events**, but that‚Äôs an app tied to _in-person speed dating events_, not an anonymous review or feedback network. It is only functional during those events, not a broader social app for ongoing reviews [apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheeky-events/id6450106982?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
- Other apps like **Cheeky Chat**, **Cheekd**, or **Cheekd Events** are unrelated concepts (e.g. structured messaging or Bluetooth-based local alerts) and _not men-only anonymous review platforms_ [apps.apple.com+3apps.apple.com+3datingscout.com+3](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/cheeky-chat-meet-play-love/id6445944385?l=en-GB&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Summary

- Although speculative platforms such as **Cheeky** or **Teaborn** have been mentioned in commentary as male-targeted counterparts to Tea, **none are currently live or available on the App Store**.
    
- Existing versions bearing similar names serve entirely different functions‚Äîmostly dating logistics or event participation, **not whisper-network style feedback systems**.

## üåä Windsurf Prompt
### üß† Prompt Objective

> Build a secure, scalable, and App Store-compliant mobile app called **Scoop** that allows **men only** to anonymously share, read, and respond to red/green-flag experiences with romantic partners (mirroring the functionality of the ‚ÄúTea‚Äù app for women). Focus on robust moderation, privacy, and user verification protocols.

### üíª Full Cursor Prompt

```
You are an expert full-stack iOS engineer, AI pair programmer, and App Store deployment strategist. Your goal is to help me build and ship a Swift-based iOS app called **Scoop** ‚Äî a men-only, anonymous review platform inspired by the Tea app.

---

## üß± App Concept: Scoop (Men-Only Anonymous Dating Review App)

- Purpose: Allow male users to anonymously share reviews (positive or negative) about romantic experiences with women.
- Posts include:
  - Optional photo upload (blurred by default)
  - Relationship category: One-night stand, Long-term, Dating app match, etc.
  - Red flag / Green flag indicator
  - Tags: e.g. ‚Äúghosted,‚Äù ‚Äúlied,‚Äù ‚Äúcheated,‚Äù ‚Äúamazing communicator,‚Äù ‚Äúemotionally supportive‚Äù
  - Optional text description (max 500 characters)
- Users can react to posts or mark them as helpful
- Community features: search by name or tag, real-time alerts for new posts matching keywords
- Admin dashboard for moderation + flagging system

---

## üîê Key Requirements

1. **Male-Only Verification (Without IDs)**
   - Use onboarding questions and facial recognition (optional) or voiceprint authentication to verify gender heuristically
   - Gamify community flagging to improve self-regulation
   - Don't collect or store PII unless strictly necessary

2. **Anonymity**
   - No user-facing usernames
   - Store user data securely with UUIDs
   - End-to-end encrypted review content

3. **Moderation System**
   - Auto-flag offensive or defamatory content using OpenAI moderation endpoint
   - Manual moderation dashboard for admin users
   - User voting system (e.g. if 10+ votes say "false", post is auto-hidden for review)

4. **Security & Privacy**
   - Use Firebase Auth or Supabase for backend auth & rate-limiting
   - Apple Sign-In integration required for App Store compliance
   - Blur all photos by default until tapped
   - Remove EXIF metadata on upload

5. **UI/UX**
   - Use SwiftUI for frontend
   - Dark mode by default
   - Onboarding: ‚ÄúWhat is Scoop?‚Äù ‚Üí Gender verification ‚Üí Terms agreement ‚Üí Start browsing
   - Tabs: Feed | Search | Submit | Alerts | Profile

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack Preferences

- Frontend: SwiftUI
- Backend: Supabase (or Firebase)
- Moderation: OpenAI Moderation API + custom admin flag dashboard
- Notifications: OneSignal or Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Analytics: Mixpanel or Firebase Analytics
- Deployment: TestFlight ‚Üí App Store
- Hosting: Vercel or Supabase edge functions for minimal latency

---

## üéØ Deliverables You Should Help Me Generate

1. SwiftUI components for Feed, Search, Post Modal, Profile
2. Supabase schema for users, reviews, tags, votes
3. Moderation logic with OpenAI moderation API
4. Secure photo upload logic with automatic metadata strip + blur
5. Apple-compliant App Privacy Policy & Terms of Use (AI-generated OK for v1)
6. Deployment steps for TestFlight & App Store submission
7. Best practices for app icon, screenshots, and App Store listing

---

## üß† Philosophy

This app is not about hate or harassment. It‚Äôs about protecting men from repeated negative dating experiences and celebrating green flags. Anonymity must never come at the cost of another person‚Äôs safety. Every feature must balance transparency with empathy.

---

Please begin with the backend schema and SwiftUI file structure.

## ‚úÖ Guardrails to Prevent App Store Rejection

|Area|Implementation|
|---|---|
|**Male-only access**|Heuristic (non-ID) gender filter with onboarding self-attest + optional voiceprint; NO discrimination.|
|**No real names**|No fields accept first/last names of people being reviewed.|
|**No PII sharing**|Moderation filters block any form of phone numbers, usernames, photos of others, etc.|
|**Moderation**|All posts pass OpenAI‚Äôs moderation endpoint + in-house filters before going live.|
|**Anonymity limits**|Users have UUIDs, but all content is traceable (for abuse control).|
|**Report feature**|Built-in ability to flag reviews; abuse leads to suspension or ban.|
|**Blurred media**|All uploaded photos are blurred by default with no zoom enabled.|
|**Policy compliance**|Privacy Policy + Terms of Use autogenerated for App Store review.|

## üß© Dirt Supabase Schema (PostgreSQL SQL)

Here‚Äôs the **production-ready Supabase schema** for your Scoop MVP ‚Äî designed to support anonymity, robust moderation, and App Store compliance.

### üîê Key Compliance & Safeguards

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`is_visible`|Used to soft-hide content after community flags or mod review|
|`content` length capped|Ensures bite-sized, low-defamation potential|
|No real names enforced|No name fields stored in schema or allowed in UI|
|`apple_id` stored safely|Only the opaque token, not user PII|
|Flagging with reason|Enables mod accountability + transparency|
|`tags` structured|Prevents offensive slang and ensures clean sentiment filtering|

## üß≠ Components

Here are production-grade SwiftUI components for your Scoop MVP, fully structured, reusable, and annotated for clarity and App Store compliance. These include the **FeedView** and **PostView**, which handle review browsing and anonymous posting.

### `FeedView.swift`

```
import SwiftUI

struct FeedView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = FeedViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(viewModel.reviews) { review in
                    ReviewCard(review: review)
                        .padding(.vertical, 6)
                        .onTapGesture {
                            viewModel.toggleBlur(for: review)
                        }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Scoop Feed")
            .onAppear {
                viewModel.fetchReviews()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### `ReviewCard.swift`

```
import SwiftUI

struct ReviewCard: View {
    let review: Review

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
            HStack {
                Text(review.flagType == .red ? "üö© Red Flag" : "‚úÖ Green Flag")
                    .font(.headline)
                    .foregroundColor(review.flagType == .red ? .red : .green)
                Spacer()
                Text(review.category)
                    .font(.caption)
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
            }

            if let imageURL = review.imageURL {
                AsyncImage(url: URL(string: imageURL)) { image in
                    image
                        .resizable()
                        .scaledToFit()
                        .blur(radius: review.isBlurred ? 12 : 0)
                        .cornerRadius(8)
                } placeholder: {
                    ProgressView()
                }
            }

            Text(review.content)
                .font(.body)

            TagListView(tags: review.tags)

            HStack {
                Button(action: { viewModel.upvote(review) }) {
                    Label("Helpful", systemImage: "hand.thumbsup")
                }
                Spacer()
                Button(action: { viewModel.flag(review) }) {
                    Label("Report", systemImage: "flag")
                        .foregroundColor(.red)
                }
            }
            .font(.caption)
        }
        .padding()
        .background(Color(UIColor.systemBackground))
        .cornerRadius(12)
        .shadow(radius: 2)
    }
}
```

### `PostView.swift` (Create New Review)

```
import SwiftUI
import PhotosUI

struct PostView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = PostViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {

                        Text("Green Flag").tag("green")
                    }.pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())
                }

                Section(header: Text("Relationship Type")) {
                    Picker("Category", selection: $viewModel.category) {
                        ForEach(viewModel.categories, id: \.self) { cat in
                            Text(cat)
                        }
                    }
                }

                Section(header: Text("Tags")) {
                    TagSelectorView(selectedTags: $viewModel.selectedTags)
                }

                Section(header: Text("Story (max 500 chars)")) {
                    TextEditor(text: $viewModel.content)
                        .frame(minHeight: 100)
                }

                Section(header: Text("Optional Photo (blurred)")) {
                    PhotosPicker("Select Photo", selection: $viewModel.selectedImage)
                    if let preview = viewModel.imagePreview {
                        Image(uiImage: preview)
                            .resizable()
                            .scaledToFit()
                            .blur(radius: 12)
                    }
                }

                Section {
                    Button("Submit") {
                        viewModel.submitPost()
                    }
                    .disabled(!viewModel.isFormValid)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Post a Review")
        }
    }

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. Moderator Panel Tools (Admin UI Spec)

#### üîß UI: `FlaggedPostsView.swift`

```
struct FlaggedPostsView: View {
    @StateObject private var modVM = ModerationViewModel()

    var body: some View {

                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(flagged.content).lineLimit(3)
                    HStack {
                        Button("Hide Post") {
                            modVM.hidePost(flagged)
                        }
                        Button("Ban User") {
                            modVM.banUser(flagged.userID)
                        }
                    }.buttonStyle(BorderlessButtonStyle())
                }
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle("Moderation Queue")
        .onAppear {
            modVM.loadFlaggedReviews()
        }
    }
}
```

#### üîê Logic: `ModerationViewModel.swift`

```
class ModerationViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var flaggedReviews: [Review] = []

    func loadFlaggedReviews() {
        SupabaseManager.shared.fetchFlaggedReviews { result in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.flaggedReviews = result
            }
        }
    }

## üí∏ Monetization Architecture for Dirt

Let‚Äôs now integrate monetization into your **Scoop MVP**, modeled after Tea‚Äôs system ‚Äî while staying 100% App Store-compliant.

We‚Äôll use **StoreKit 2** (native Swift API for in-app purchases) and design a **freemium subscription model**:

| Search by tags       | ‚úÖ Basic filters                | ‚úÖ Advanced filter logic (e.g. frequency)   |
| Keyword alerts       | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ Real-time push alerts                    |
| Community insights   | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ See most-flagged tags, most active areas |
| AI credibility check | ‚ùå                              | ‚úÖ Sentiment & veracity estimate            |
| Referrals unlock     | ‚úÖ 1 referral = 7-day Pro trial | ‚úÖ                                          |

### üß† StoreKit Setup (`SubscriptionManager.swift`)

```
import StoreKit

class SubscriptionManager: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = SubscriptionManager()

    @Published var isSubscribed: Bool = false
    @Published var products: [Product] = []

    private var updates: Task<Void, Never>? = nil

    init() {
        updates = Task {
            for await result in Transaction.updates {
                await self.updateSubscriptionStatus()
            }
        }

        Task {
            await self.loadProducts()
            await self.updateSubscriptionStatus()
        }
    }

    func loadProducts() async {
        do {
            self.products = try await Product.products(for: ["scoop_premium_monthly"])
        } catch {
            print("Error loading products: \(error)")
        }
    }

    func purchase(product: Product) async throws {
        let result = try await product.purchase()
        switch result {
        case .success(let verification):
            switch verification {
            case .verified(let transaction):
                await transaction.finish()
                await updateSubscriptionStatus()
            default:
                break
            }
        default: break
        }
    }

    func updateSubscriptionStatus() async {
        for await result in Transaction.currentEntitlements {
            if case .verified(let transaction) = result,
               transaction.productID == "scoop_premium_monthly" {
                await MainActor.run {
                    self.isSubscribed = true
                }
                return
            }
        }
        await MainActor.run {
            self.isSubscribed = false
        }
    }
}
```

### üßæ `PaywallView.swift`

```
import SwiftUI
import StoreKit

struct PaywallView: View {
    @StateObject var subManager = SubscriptionManager.shared

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("Upgrade to Scoop Pro")
                .font(.largeTitle).bold()
            Text("Get advanced search, tag alerts, trend insights, and more.")
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)

            ForEach(subManager.products) { product in
                Button("Subscribe ‚Äì \(product.displayPrice)") {
                    Task {
                        try? await subManager.purchase(product: product)
                    }
                }
                .padding()
                .background(Color.blue)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .cornerRadius(10)
            }

            Button("Restore Purchases") {
                Task { try? await AppStore.sync() }
            }

            Spacer()
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### üîê Example Gated Access (e.g. Tag Search in FeedViewModel)

```
if !SubscriptionManager.shared.isSubscribed {
    // Basic search: show top 5 tags only
    self.filteredTags = allTags.prefix(5)
} else {
    self.filteredTags = allTags
}
```

### üéÅ `ReferralManager.swift` (Conceptual)

```
class ReferralManager {
    static let shared = ReferralManager()

    func redeemReferral(code: String, completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) {
        // Check Supabase for referral code, give 7-day access if valid
        SupabaseManager.shared.redeemReferralCode(code: code) { success in
            if success {
                SubscriptionManager.shared.isSubscribed = true
            }
            completion(success)
        }
    }

    func generateCode(for userID: UUID) -> String {
        return "SCOOP-\(userID.uuidString.prefix(8))"
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ App Store Compliant Monetization Strategy

- StoreKit2 (Apple-approved)
    
- Feature gating only on **enhancements**, not core usage
    
- Referral unlocks are allowed (no cash rewards = safe)
    
- Content moderation, no pay-to-harass features
